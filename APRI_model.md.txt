Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It can be transmitted by contact with contaminated blood, such as sharing needles, syringes and other objects for drug use, personal care, tattooing or piercing. Hepatitis C can cause acute or chronic infection. Approximately 30% (15–45%) of infected persons present spontaneous viral clearance within 6 months of infection without any treatment. This virus 
can be diagnosed by blood tests that detect the presence of anti-HCV antibodies and viral load (HCV-RNA). The treatment of hepatitis C is done with drug called direct-acting antivirals (DAA), which have cure rates of over 95% and are usually taken for 12 to 24 weeks, depending on the absence or presence of cirrhosis.

Know the stage of liver fibrosis is essential in managing chronic hepatitis C patients (1,2). A model created by Chun-Tao Wai et al (3), was implemented in ApriGul. It uses an Index in Predicting Liver Fibrosis named APRI (aspartate aminotransferase to platelet count ratio index). View a formula:
           
            AST level (/ULN)
APRI = —————————————————————————
        Platelet counts (10⁹/L)
